# Example case

I have a special interest in the fight against corruption, the question from which this project starts using data is: Are there interesting anomalies to investigate in the purchases of the municipality of Monterrey during December 2020?

This work does not seek to replace the journalistic effort, very necessary to validate the results of the analysis and seek, through an impartial and objective investigation, the detection of corruption.
